üìö Section 1: Imports and Libraries
import os: This line imports the os module, which provides operating system functionality, such as file and directory manipulation, and environment variable access.
import fitz # PyMuPDF: Here, we're importing the fitz module (also known as PyMuPDF). It's used for working with PDF files, allowing you to read, write, and manipulate PDF content.
import re: This statement imports the re module, which is used for working with regular expressions. Regular expressions are patterns for searching and replacing text within strings.
import tkinter as tk: Here, we're importing the tkinter module and renaming it as tk. tkinter is a graphical library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python.
from tkinter import filedialog, messagebox: This line imports the filedialog and messagebox functions from the tkinter module. filedialog allows the user to select files or directories through dialog boxes, while messagebox displays warning, informational, or error messages in dialog boxes.
from tkinter.scrolledtext import ScrolledText: Here, we're importing the ScrolledText class from the tkinter module. This class creates a text area with scrollbars, useful for displaying and editing long text in a GUI.
üìë Section 2: PDF Text Extraction Function
The extract_text_from_pdf function is responsible for extracting text from a PDF file.
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path): Defines the function, which takes the path to the PDF file (pdf_path) as an argument.
text = "": Initializes a text variable as an empty string, which will store the extracted text from the PDF.
try:: Begins a try block to handle potential exceptions during PDF file reading.
document = fitz.open(pdf_path): Opens the PDF file using the fitz.open function and stores the document object in the document variable.
for page_num in range(len(document)): Iterates over each page in the PDF document, using the range function to generate a sequence of numbers corresponding to the page indices.
page = document.load_page(page_num): Loads the current page of the document into the page variable.
text += page.get_text("text"): Extracts the text from the current page using the page.get_text("text") function and appends the text to the text variable.
except Exception as e:: except block to catch any exception that occurs within the try block.
